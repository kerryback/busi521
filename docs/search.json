Understanding how assets are priced is also important for issuing entities, like corporations, so asset pricing is also part of the foundation for corporate finance. Of course, prices are determined by supply and demand. We take supply (a topic in corporate finance) as given in this course and study demand (portfolio choice).\nUncertainty and time are the two key elements of portfolio choice. We will start with single-period models and then move to dynamic models in both discrete and continuous time. We’ll develop the theory of dynamic programming in continuous time and use it to study portfolio choice and some corporate investment decisions. Dynamic programming and other aspects of the mathematics of uncertainty in continuous time are useful in other areas of economics and finance as well.\n\n\n\nThis is a cross-listed course between the Jones School and the School of Social Sciences.

Derive the first-order condition for a portfolio to be on the mean-variance frontier. Explain why the first-order condition implies a factor model for returns.\nAssume there is a representative investor with constant relative risk aversion \\(\\rho \\neq 1\\). Let \\(c_0\\) denote aggregate consumption at date 0 and let \\(\\tilde{c}_1\\) denote aggregate consumption at date \\(1\\). Assume \\(\\log \\tilde{c}_1\\) is normally distributed with mean \\(\\log c_0 + \\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\).\n\nDerive a formula for \\(\\log R_f\\).\n\nExplain (in terms of the demand to borrow and market clearing) why \\(\\log R_f\\) is larger when \\(\\mu\\) is larger and larger when \\(\\sigma\\) is smaller.\nWhy is the effect of \\(\\rho\\) on \\(\\log R_f\\) ambiguous?\n\nAssume all investors have linear risk tolerance with the same cautiousness parameter. Explain why fact (a) below implies (b) and (c). Along the way, explain the concepts referenced in the facts.\n\nSharing rules are affine.\nA competitive equilibrium is Pareto optimal as long as there is a risk-free asset (markets do not need to be complete).\nThere is two-fund separation.\n\nConsider an investor who seeks to maximize \\[E \\left[\\sum_{t=0}^T \\delta^t u(c_t)\\right]\\] where \\[u(c) = \\frac{1}{1-\\rho}c^{1-\\rho}\\] subject to the intertemporal budget constraint and subject to the terminal constraint \\(C_T \\leq W_T\\)’. Assume returns are iid. Let \\(J_t(w)\\) denote the value function.

If we divide by the payoff by the cost of the portfolio, we obtain a return. Thus, the random variable is proportional to a return. Show that in fact it is proportional to a return \\(\\pi'\\widetilde{\\mathbf{R}} + (1-\\iota'\\pi)R_f\\) on the mean-variance frontier. You can use without proof any facts that you know about the mean-variance frontier.\n\nAssume there is a representative investor with constant relative risk aversion \\(\\rho\\) and discount factor \\(\\delta\\).

Derive the optimal portfolio for an investor with CARA utility.\nAssume there are \\(n\\) assets and \\(k\\) states of the world.

Derive a generalization of the CAPM of the following form: for each asset \\(i\\), \\[E[ \\tilde R_i]-R_f = \\gamma_i \\bigg(E[ \\tilde R_m]-R_f\\bigg)\\] where \\(\\gamma_i\\) is a generalization of the market beta of asset \\(i\\). Give an explicit formula for \\(\\gamma_i\\).\nSuppose all investors have log utility and suppose \\(( \\tilde w_1,\\ldots, \\tilde w_H)\\) is a Pareto optimal allocation of market wealth \\(\\tilde w_m\\). Show that each investor’s wealth \\(\\tilde w_h\\) is an affine function of \\(\\tilde w_m\\).\nAssume there are four equally probable states of the world, a risk-free asset with return \\(R_f=1.5\\), and two risky assets with the following payoffs:\n\n\n\n\n\nState 1\nState 2\nState 3\nState 4\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\tilde{x}_1\\):\n3\n3\n1\n1\n\n\n\\(\\tilde{x}_2\\):\n1\n5\n2\n4\n\n\n\nThe prices of the two risky assets are \\(p_1 = 1\\) and \\(p_2=2\\). Show that the random variable having the following values in each state is an SDF.\n\n\n\nState 1\nState 2\nState 3\nState 4\n\n\n\n\n1/3\n1/3\n1\n1\n\n\n\n\nSuppose there are two risk-averse investors and three states of the world. Suppose that the equilibrium end-of-period wealths of the two investors are as follows. Can we tell whether the market is complete? Explain.\n\n\n\n\n\nState 1\nState 2\nState 3\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\tilde{w}_1\\):\n1\n4\n3\n\n\n\\(\\tilde{w}_2\\):\n2\n3\n5\n\n\n\n\nConsider a single-period model with a risk-free asset and a single risky asset. Let \\(\\phi(w)\\) denote the optimal investment in the risky asset for an investor when the investor’s initial wealth is \\(w\\). Under what circumstance is \\(\\phi'(w)>0\\)?\nDefine two-fund separation. What assumption on investor preferences implies two-fund separation?\nLet \\(\\tilde{m}\\) be an SDF and define a probability \\(Q\\) by \\(Q(A) = R_f E[\\tilde{m}1_A]\\) for each event \\(A\\). Show that the return \\(\\tilde{R}\\) of each asset must satisfy \\(E^*[\\tilde{R}] = R_f\\), where \\(E^*\\) denotes expectation relative to \\(Q\\).\nDerive the global minimum variance portfolio.\nSuppose \\(\\tilde{m}\\) is an SDF and there are constants \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that \\(a+b\\tilde{m}\\) is a return.
