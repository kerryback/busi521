3.  Assume there is a representative investor with constant relative risk aversion $\rho \neq 1$.  Let $c_0$ denote aggregate consumption at date 0 and let $\tilde{c}_1$ denote aggregate consumption at date $1$.  Assume $\log \tilde{c}_1$ is normally distributed with mean $\log c_0 + \mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$.  
    (a) Derive a formula for $\log R_f$.  
    (b) Explain (in terms of the demand to borrow and market clearing) why $\log R_f$ is larger when $\mu$ is larger and larger when $\sigma$ is smaller.
    (c) Why is the effect of $\rho$ on $\log R_f$ ambiguous?

    (a) Sharing rules are affine.
    (b) A competitive equilibrium is Pareto optimal as long as there is a risk-free asset (markets do not need to be complete).

5. Consider an investor who seeks to maximize
$$E \left[\sum_{t=0}^T \delta^t u(c_t)\right]$$
where
$$u(c) = \frac{1}{1-\rho}c^{1-\rho}$$
subject to the intertemporal budget constraint and subject to the terminal constraint $C_T \leq W_T$'.  Assume returns are iid.  Let $J_t(w)$ denote the value function. Define
$$B = \max_\pi E\left[\frac{1}{1-\rho}(\pi'R_T)^{1-\rho}\right]\,.$$
Show that the optimal portfolio at date $T-1$ is the portfolio that achieves this maximum, and show that
$$J_{T-1}(w) = \frac{1}{1-\rho}A_{T-1}w^{1-\rho}$$
for some constant $A_{T-1}$.
6.  Assume there is a risk-free asset.  Let $\widetilde{\mathbf{R}}$ denote the vector of risky asset returns, let $\mu$ denote the mean of $\widetilde{\mathbf{R}}$,  and let $\Sigma$ denote the covariance matrix of $\widetilde{\mathbf{R}}$.  Let $\iota$ denote a vector of 1's.  
    (a) Show that the following random variable is an SDF.
$$
\frac{1}{R_f} + \left(\iota -\frac{1}{R_f}\mu\right)'\Sigma^{-1}(\widetilde{\mathbf{R}}-\mu)\,.
$$
    (b) The random variable in part (a) is spanned by the assets, so it is the payoff of a portfolio (that may include the risk-free asset).  If we divide by the payoff by the cost of the portfolio, we obtain a return.  Thus, the random variable is proportional to a return.  Show that in fact it is proportional to a return $\pi'\widetilde{\mathbf{R}} + (1-\iota'\pi)R_f$ on the mean-variance frontier.  You can use without proof any facts that you know about the mean-variance frontier.

Assume the Law of One Price holds and the market is complete.  Derive the unique state price vector and explain the derivation.

13.  Assume there is a risk-free asset and a representative investor with CRRA utility.  Let $\tilde R_m$ denote the market return.  Derive a generalization of the CAPM of the following form:  for each asset $i$,

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $\tilde{x}_1$: | 3 | 3 | 1 | 1 |
| $\tilde{x}_2$: | 1 | 5 | 2 | 4 |
