    "text": "BUSI 521Rice University Spring 2025\n\nInstructor\nKerry Back  J. Howard Creekmore Professor of Finance and Professor of Economics kerryback@gmail.com\n\n\nMeeting Schedule\nTTh 2:30 – 3:45 1/14/2024 – 4/24/2024 McNair 218\n\n\nTA and Review Sessions\nNicole Fleskes F 1:00 – 2:00 Kraft 402\n\n\nTextbook\nAsset Pricing and Portfolio Choice Theory, Oxford University Press, 2nd Edition, 2017.\n\n\nCourse Description\nThis course is an introduction to asset pricing and portfolio choice theory. This is the foundation for the ‘investments’ branch of finance. Understanding how assets are priced is also important for issuing entities, like corporations, so asset pricing is also part of the foundation for corporate finance. Of course, prices are determined by supply and demand. We take supply (a topic in corporate finance) as given in this course and study demand (portfolio choice).\nUncertainty and time are the two key elements of portfolio choice. We will start with single-period models and then move to dynamic models in both discrete and continuous time. We’ll develop the theory of dynamic programming in continuous time and use it to study portfolio choice and some corporate investment decisions. Dynamic programming and other aspects of the mathematics of uncertainty in continuous time are useful in other areas of economics and finance as well.\nThe middle part of the course will cover various topics that are of continuing research interest, and students will make presentations.\n\n\nCourse Calendar\nThis is a cross-listed course between the Jones School and the School of Social Sciences. We will follow the School of Social Sciences academic calendar. We meet TTh from 2:30-3:45 commencing January 14. The last class day is April 24. Per the university calendar, there will be no class on February 13 or on March 18 and March 20 (spring break). The final exam will be during exam week.\n\n\nCourse Schedule\n\nFundamentals of asset pricing (Jan 14 - Feb 25)\n\nPreferences, FOC, and discount factors (Chapters 1–3)\nMean-variance analysis and factor picing (Chapters 5 & 6)\nEquilibrium, efficiency, and representative investors (Chapters 4 & 7)\n\nTopics (student presentations, Feb 27 - Mar 13)\n\nHeterogenous beliefs and short sale constraints (Chapter 21)\nBubbles (Chapter 21)\nBayesian learning (Chapter 22)\nRational expectations equilibria (Chapter 22)\nGlosten-Milgrom and Kyle models (Chapter 24)\nGlosten model of limit-order markets (Chapter 24)\nCommon value auctions (Chapter 24)\nAllais paradox and betweenness preferences (Chapter 25)\nGeneralized disappointment aversion (Chapter 25)\nEllsberg paradox and ambiguity aversion (Chapter 25)\n\nContinuous time methods and applications (Mar 25 - Apr 24)\n\nBrownian motion and stochastic calculus (Chapter 12)\nDynamic programming (Chapters 9, 14, & 20)\nOptimal timing problems (Chapters 15 & 19)\nBayesian learning in continuous time (Chapter 23)\n\n\n\n\nClass Presentations\nThe topics listed above will be assigned to students one-to-one. In addition to the textbook material, each student should draw heavily from at least one published paper, either a seminal paper on the topic or an application. Presentations should be roughly 20 minutes plus Q&A.\n\n\nGrading\nGrades will be based on class participation, individual homework assignments, class presentations, and a final exam. Late homeworks will not be accepted, but I will drop the lowest homework score.\n\n\nHonor Code\nThe Rice University Honor Code applies to all work in this course. The intent of the Honor Code in general and specifically in this course is to ensure that each student claims and receives credit for their own efforts. The intent is not to limit the valuable exchange of ideas through discussion among fellow students. The atmosphere at Rice University must be one of academic and personal integrity. Any suspected violations of the Honor Code are submitted to the Rice University Honor Council.\n\n\nDisability Accommodations\nAny student with a disability requiring accommodations in this class should contact me after contacting the Disabled Student Services office"
