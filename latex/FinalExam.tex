\begin{enumerate}
\item Assume there are $n$ risky assets and a risk-free asset in a single-period model.  Derive a formula for the maximum possible Sharpe ratio.
\item Consider an investor with log utility in a continuous-time model with a single state variable $X$.  Show that if the investor's value function is $J(w,x) = a \log w + f(x)$ for a constant $a$ and function $f$, then $f$ must satisfy a certain ODE.  Derive the ODE.  Also, derive the optimal portfolio for the investor.
\item Assume the price $S$ of a non-dividend-paying is a geometric Brownian motion.  Assume there is a constant risk-free rate.  Consider a security that pays the following at a given date $T$:
$$\begin{cases}
K_1 & \text{if $S_T < K_1$}\\
S_T & \text{if $K_1 \le S_T \le K_2$}\\
K_2  & \text{if $S_T > K_2$}
\end{cases}
$$
for constants $K_1<K_2$.  Derive a PDE that the value of the security must satisfy.  Also, explain how you would price this security using an SDF process.  Give as much detail as you can about pricing using an SDF process, starting with describing the SDF process.
\end{enumerate}
