Howard Creekmore Professor of Finance and Professor of Economics kerryback@gmail.com\n\n\n\nTTh 2:30 – 3:45, 1/9/2024 – 4/18/2024\n\n\n\nAsset Pricing and Portfolio Choice Theory, Oxford University Press, 2nd Edition, 2017.\n\n\n\nThis course is an introduction to asset pricing and portfolio choice theory. This is the foundation for the ‘investments’ branch of finance. Understanding how assets are priced is also important for issuing entities, like corporations, so asset pricing is also part of the foundation for corporate finance. Of course, prices are determined by supply and demand. We take supply (a topic in corporate finance) as given in this course and study demand (portfolio choice).\nUncertainty and time are the two key elements of portfolio choice. We will start with single-period models and then move to dynamic models in both discrete and continuous time. We’ll develop the theory of dynamic programming in continuous time and use it to study portfolio choice and some corporate investment decisions. Dynamic programming and other aspects of the mathematics of uncertainty in continuous time are useful in other areas of economics and finance as well.\n\n\n\nThis is a cross-listed course between the Jones School and the School of Social Sciences. We will follow the School of Social Sciences academic calendar. We meet TTh from 2:30-3:45 commencing January 9. The last class day is April 19. Per the university calendar, there will be on class on February 8 or on March 12 and March 14 (spring break). The midterm exam will be February 27. The final exam will be during exam week.\n\n\n\nGrades will be based 20% on individual homework assignments, 30% on the midterm exam, 10% on class participation, and 40% on the final exam. Class participation means being present and attentive in class.\n\n\n\nThe Rice University Honor Code applies to all work in this course. The intent of the Honor Code in general and specifically in this course is to ensure that each student claims and receives credit for their own efforts. The intent is not to limit the valuable exchange of ideas through discussion among fellow students. The atmosphere at Rice University must be one of academic and personal integrity. Any suspected violations of the Honor Code are submitted to the Rice University Honor Council.\n\n\n\nAny student with a disability requiring accommodations in this class should contact me after contacting the Disabled Student Services office"
