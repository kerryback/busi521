#### Course Description

This course is an introduction to asset pricing and portfolio choice theory. This is the foundation for the ‘investments’ branch of finance. Understanding
how assets are priced is also important for issuing entities, like corporations, so asset
pricing is also part of the foundation for corporate finance. Of course, prices are determined by supply and demand. We take supply (a topic in corporate finance) as given in
this course and study demand (portfolio choice).

Uncertainty and time are the two key elements of portfolio choice. We will start with
single-period models and then move to dynamic models in both discrete and continuous
time. We’ll develop the theory of dynamic programming in continuous time and use it to
study portfolio choice and some corporate investment decisions. Dynamic programming
and other aspects of the mathematics of uncertainty in continuous time are useful in
other areas of economics and finance as well.

#### Course Calendar

This is a cross-listed course between the Jones School and the School of Social Sciences.  We will follow the School of Social Sciences academic calendar.
