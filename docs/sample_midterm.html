<li>Assume there is a representative investor with constant relative risk aversion <span class="math inline">\(\rho \neq 1\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(c_0\)</span> denote aggregate consumption at date 0 and let <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{c}_1\)</span> denote aggregate consumption at date <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.

</li>
<li>Explain (in terms of the demand to borrow and market clearing) why <span class="math inline">\(\log R_f\)</span> is larger when <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is larger and larger when <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is smaller.</li>
<li>Why is the effect of <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(\log R_f\)</span> ambiguous?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Assume all investors have linear risk tolerance with the same cautiousness parameter. Explain why fact (a) below implies (b) and (c). Along the way, explain the concepts referenced in the facts.
<ol type="a">
<li>Sharing rules are affine.</li>
<li>A competitive equilibrium is Pareto optimal as long as there is a risk-free asset (markets do not need to be complete).</li>
<li>There is two-fund separation.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Consider an investor who seeks to maximize <span class="math display">\[E \left[\sum_{t=0}^T \delta^t u(c_t)\right]\]</span> where <span class="math display">\[u(c) = \frac{1}{1-\rho}c^{1-\rho}\]</span> subject to the intertemporal budget constraint and subject to the terminal constraint <span class="math inline">\(C_T \leq W_T\)</span>’. Assume returns are iid. Let <span class="math inline">\(J_t(w)\)</span> denote the value function. Define <span class="math display">\[B = \max_\pi E\left[\frac{1}{1-\rho}(\pi'R_T)^{1-\rho}\right]\,.\]</span> Show that the optimal portfolio at date <span class="math inline">\(T-1\)</span> is the portfolio that achieves this maximum, and show that <span class="math display">\[J_{T-1}(w) = \frac{1}{1-\rho}A_{T-1}w^{1-\rho}\]</span> for some constant <span class="math inline">\(A_{T-1}\)</span>.</li>

\]</span></li>
<li>The random variable in part (a) is spanned by the assets, so it is the payoff of a portfolio (that may include the risk-free asset). If we divide by the payoff by the cost of the portfolio, we obtain a return. Thus, the random variable is proportional to a return. Show that in fact it is proportional to a return <span class="math inline">\(\pi'\widetilde{\mathbf{R}} + (1-\iota'\pi)R_f\)</span> on the mean-variance frontier.

<li>Assume there are <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> assets and <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> states of the world. Let <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> denote the <span class="math inline">\(n \times k\)</span> matrix of asset payoffs (so <span class="math inline">\(x_{ij}\)</span> is the payoff of the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th asset in the <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>th state). Assume the Law of One Price holds and the market is complete. Derive the unique state price vector and explain the derivation.</li>
