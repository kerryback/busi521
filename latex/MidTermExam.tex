\begin{enumerate}
%\item Explain the meaning of the following sentence: ``Expected utility investors have second-order risk aversion.''
\item Explain the meaning of the following and prove it.  Clearly state definitions of terms and any assumptions you make.  ``Risk premia depend on covariances with an SDF.''
%\item Explain what it means for a market to be complete.  
%\item Assume there are $n$ risky assets whose returns have a joint normal distribution.  Assume also that there is a risk-free asset.  Derive the optimal portfolio for a CARA investor.
\item Assume there are $n$ risky assets (not necessarily joint normal).  Assume there is a risk-free asset.  Show that a mean-variance frontier portfolio return is a pricing factor.  Clearly state definitions of terms and any assumptions you make.
%\item Under the same assumptions as in the previous question, derive a formula for the maximum possible Sharpe ratio.
\item Derive a formula for the risk-free return when there is a representative investor with CRRA utility and the change in log consumption is normally distributed.
\item What is the form of Pareto optimal sharing rules when all investors have log utility?  Prove it.
\end{enumerate}
